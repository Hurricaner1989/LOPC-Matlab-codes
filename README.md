# LOPC Matlab package
# Matlab code implementing LOPC algorithm from Zuo et. al.'s Methods paper (Biological network inference using low order partial correlation)

## 07/11/16, I submit version 1.0 which contains four Matlab functions (i.e., falseDiscoveryRate.m, firstParCorr.m, secParCorr.m, lopc.m) and one demo (i.e., demo.m and files in Data folder). lopc.m implements our proposed LOPC algorithm in Methods paper. firstParCorr.m and secParCorr.m are traditional methods to calculate low order partial correlation up to first and second order, respectively. They are used for comparisons in demo. falseDiscoveryRate.m implements a function to calculate adjusted p-value from a p-value matrix.

## 07/12/16, I make a few changes on the demo file.
